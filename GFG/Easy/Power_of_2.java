/* Given a non-negative integer n. You have to check if it is a power of 2 or not. 

Examples

Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 is equal to 2 raised to 3 (23 = 8).
Input: n = 98
Output: false
Explanation: 98 cannot be obtained by any power of 2.
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: (20 = 1).
Constraints:
0 ≤ n < 109
