/* Given an array arr[], determine whether it represents the level-order traversal of a valid max heap. Return true if it does; otherwise, return false.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [90, 15, 10, 7, 12, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: The given array represents the following tree. Each parent node is greater than or equal to its children, so the max-heap property holds.
 
Input: arr[] = [9, 15, 10, 7, 12, 11]
Output: false
Explanation: The given array represents the following tree. It does not satisfy the max-heap property, as 9 is smaller than 15 and 10, and 10 is smaller than 11.
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
