/* Given an integer k representing the number of people to be seated and an array seats[], where 0 denotes an empty seat and 1 denotes an occupied seat.

Determine whether it is possible to seat all k people such that no two occupied seats are adjacent (including newly seated people).

Examples:

Input: k = 2, seats[] = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: The two people can sit at index 0 and 4.
Input: k = 1, seats[] = [0, 1, 0]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to get a seat for one person.
Input: k = 0, seats[] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: The seating arrangement already contains two adjacent occupied seats at indices 3 and 4.
Constraints:
0 ≤ k ≤ 105
1 ≤ seats.size() ≤ 105
seats[i] == 0 or seats[i] == 1
