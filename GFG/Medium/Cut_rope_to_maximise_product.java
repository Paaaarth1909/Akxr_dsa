/* Given a rope of length n meters, cut it into multiple smaller ropes such that the product of their lengths is maximized. At least one cut is mandatory.

Examples:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: Since 1 cut is mandatory. Maximum obtainable product is 1 * 1 = 1.
Input: n = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: Maximum obtainable product is 2 * 3 = 6.
Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 58
