/* Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers, the task is to find the length of the Longest Strictly Increasing Subsequence (LIS).
A subsequence is strictly increasing if each element in the subsequence is strictly less than the next element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 8, 3, 7, 9, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest strictly increasing subsequence could be [5, 7, 9], which has a length of 3.
Input: arr[] = [10, 6, 3, 11, 7, 15]
Output: 3
Explanation: One of the possible longest strictly increasing subsequences is [10, 11, 15], which has a length of 3.
Input: arr[] = [3, 10, 2, 1, 20]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest strictly increasing subsequence could be [3, 10, 20], which has a length of 3.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 103
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
